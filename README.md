Forking a repo:
  A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
steps involved are as follows-
   
1.consider any repository which is not our's and there we will see a fork option then we have to click on that.
   
2.Next,we have to create local clone of our fork.For this,we have to copy the url from the code section and then we have to open Git bash and we have to set the path and then       we have to type "git clone url" command in it.
   
3. Next,we have to type "git remote -v" and press Enter. we will see the current configured remote repository for our fork.
   
4.Next,we have to type git remote add upstream, and then pasting the URL we copied in Step 2 and press Enter. 
   
5.To verify the new upstream repository we've specified for our fork, we have to type git remote -v again. we will see the URL for our fork as origin, and the URL for the           original repository as upstream.

Likewise a repository is forked.
